# Tesla.com Clone Project

Welcome to the Tesla.com Clone project! This project was developed during my training period at IJSE (Institute of Software Engineering) as a Training Fullstack Developer. It served as an excellent opportunity for me to practice and enhance my skills in pure HTML5 and CSS3, utilizing various techniques and best practices.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aimed to create a comprehensive clone of the Tesla.com website using pure HTML5 and CSS3. By focusing on these technologies, I challenged myself to understand the core concepts of web development and create a visually appealing user interface.

## Features

Throughout the project, I employed the following techniques and features:

- Utilized the latest HTML5 semantic tags for structuring the web pages.
- Implemented CSS3 to style the web pages, ensuring a modern and visually appealing design.
